# Developer documentation

## Overview

This documentation defines a standardized approach for integrating gift card providers with commercetools Checkout. The integration pattern and structure are provided as a template, enabling gift card providers to implement their own solutions in a consistent and efficient manner. This framework ensures that gift cards are treated as a payment method , such as credit cards, ensuring a seamless checkout experience for users, streamlining the integration process and enhancing flexibility for different providers. 

## Scope

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the system architecture and a detailed guide for implementing the integration. It covers the necessary technical specifications and outlines how to manage gift cards as part of the payment workflow within commercetools.

## Solution

### System Architecture Diagram


### Components Overview

The integration is composed of several interconnected components, each playing a specific role in enabling the seamless use of gift cards as a payment method within commercetools. Below is an overview of these components:

1. #### commercetools Connect
commercetools Connect provides a runtime environment for executing small applications or "connectors" within the commercetools platform. The integration runs within this environment and consists of two key applications:
   * **Enabler**
   A JavaScript library that is loaded into the browser during the commercetools Checkout process. The Enabler is responsible for displaying the necessary input fields for gift card information (e.g., card number, PIN) and exposes functions like `balance()` and `submit()` to facilitate interaction between the frontend and backend systems.
   * **Processor**
   A backend application that exposes an API to handle requests from both the Enabler (frontend) and commercetools Checkout (backend). The Processor acts as the middle layer that interacts with the gift card provider (e.g., for balance checks, redemptions) and ensures the payment information is updated in the commercetools Core Commerce platform.

2. #### Gift Card Provider
The external system responsible for managing the gift card details. It holds the gift card information, including balance retrieval, redemption, cancellation, and voiding operations. The Processor communicates with the Gift Card Provider to execute these operations.

3. #### commercetools Checkout
commercetools Checkout is the system that orchestrates the payment process. It displays available payment methods (e.g., gift cards, credit cards) to the user on the merchant’s website and is responsible for converting a Cart into an Order. The Checkout system uses the integration to handle gift cards as a payment method.

4. #### commercetools Session
The commercetools Session API allows the storage and management of session data. The session is critical for maintaining state and trust between the frontend (Enabler) and backend (Processor), ensuring secure interactions during the payment flow.

5. #### commercetools OAuth
The OAuth server is responsible for issuing and validating client credentials for server-to-server authentication. OAuth is used to authorize requests between the Processor and commercetools Core Commerce.


### Data Flow

The integration follows a structured data flow to ensure smooth operation between commercetools Checkout, the gift card provider, and the connector components. The key steps in the data flow are as follows:

1. **Session Creation:** 
   * commercetools Checkout creates a session to store the necessary cart information. The session holds details such as the processor URL, payment service provider (PSP), and the `paymentInterface` information (which will be set on the `PaymentMethodInfo` object in the payment payload) as defined in the [commercetools Payments API](https://docs.commercetools.com/api/projects/payments#ctp:api:type:PaymentMethodInfo).

2. **Displaying Input Fields:** 
   * The Enabler, loaded by commercetools Checkout, displays the required input fields for the user to input their gift card details (e.g., card number, security code). Additionally, it exposes a `balance()` function, which commercetools Checkout invokes to retrieve the gift card balance.

3. **Balance Check:** 
   * The Enabler calls the Processor’s API to retrieve the gift card balance. The Processor, in turn, communicates with the Gift Card Provider to authenticate and fetch the current balance.

4. Evaluate Payment Amount: 
   * Once the balance is retrieved, commercetools Checkout evaluates the available amount on the gift card and determines how much can be applied toward the total payment.

5. **Payment Submission:** 
   * commercetools Checkout calls the submit() function, exposed by the Enabler, to initiate the payment process. Along with this call, the checkout system sends the amount that needs to be charged against the gift card.

7. **Gift Card Redemption and Order Finalization:** 
   * The Enabler communicates with the Processor, which interacts with the Gift Card Provider to redeem the specified amount. 
   * The Processor then updates the payment status and records the necessary payment transactions in commercetools Core Commerce, completing the payment process and finalizing the order.

### Integration Type

The integration follows a **connector-based architecture** where two main components - **Enabler** (frontend) and **Processor** (backend) — work together. The connector offers:

* **API functionality**: Through the Processor, which communicates with the gift card provider and commercetools Core Commerce.
* **Frontend functionality**: Through the Enabler, which presents the UI elements and facilitates interactions with commercetools Checkout.

This flexible design allows the connector to operate within commercetools Checkout but can also be used as a standalone solution for custom integrations, depending on the merchant’s specific requirements.

### Integration Prerequisites

#### commercetools Setup
To integrate the gift card system with commercetools Checkout, you will need to configure API credentials with the appropriate permissions. These are the key requirements for setting up commercetools:

**API Credentials**

The integration requires an API client with specific access scopes to manage payments, carts, sessions, and other necessary operations. Ensure the API client is configured with at least the following scopes (other scopes may be required):

* `manage_payments`: Enables the management of payment information, including creating and updating payment methods.
* `manage_orders`: Allows access and updates to the cart and related order information.
* `view_sessions`: Grants permission to retrieve session information used for establishing trust between the frontend and backend.
* `view_api_clients`: Validates if the API credentials provided have the required permissions.
* `manage_checkout_payment_intents`: Supports interaction with the `/operations/*` endpoint for managing payment intents during checkout.
* `introspect_oauth_tokens`: Allows introspection of OAuth tokens to validate permissions and ensure secure authentication.

**API Client for Connector Operations**

In addition to the API credentials above, you'll need an API client capable of managing connector-related operations. This includes tasks like:

* Installing the connector
* Deploying and updating the connector
* Performing connector-related maintenance operations

For more details on setting up and managing connectors, refer to the commercetools [Connector Deployment Documentation](https://docs.commercetools.com/certifications/build-and-deploy-custom-connector/overview).

#### Gift Card System Setup

The setup for the gift card provider may vary depending on the specific system being integrated. However, there are some common configuration steps required:

1. **Gift Card Provider Configuration**
   Most gift card systems require some form of authentication or access key to interact with their API. Typically, this configuration will involve:
   * API keys or other credentials that need to be securely stored to allow the Processor to access the gift card provider’s system.

2. **Balance Retrieval**
   The gift card provider must support the ability to retrieve the balance of a specific gift card. This is a core operation required for the integration to function, as commercetools Checkout needs to know the available balance before processing the payment.

3. **Transaction Operations**
   The gift card provider should support key operations for handling transactions, including:
   * **Cancel**: Ability to cancel or void a transaction.
   * **Capture**: Support for capture of a transaction when necessary.
   * **Refund**: Ability to refund a transaction if the payment needs to be reversed.

These operations are essential for managing the payment lifecycle in case of errors, cancellations, or customer refunds.

#### Access & Authentication

The integration uses several authentication methods to ensure secure communication between different components. These include:

1. **Session Authentication**
   The integration will use session-based authentication for frontend-to-backend communication. The session information is passed via the `X-Session-Id` header, which is validated by the Processor to ensure the request is trusted and associated with the correct session.

2. **JWT Validation**
   JSON Web Tokens (JWT) are used to validate operations performed within the commercetools Merchant Center. The Processor supports JWT validation to authenticate and authorize requests for internal operations.

3. **OAuth Authentication**
   OAuth 2.0 is used for server-to-server communication to manage secure operations such as capture, cancel, and refund of payments. The OAuth credentials are validated via the `introspect_oauth_tokens` scope to ensure that the Processor has the necessary permissions for these operations.

#### Environment Setup

The integration requires setting up an appropriate environment for development and deployment. Follow these steps to configure the environment:

1. **Clone the Template Repository**
   The integration template is available at the following GitHub repository: [commercetools Connect Gift Card Integration Template](https://github.com/commercetools/connect-giftcard-integration-template).
Clone this repository to your local environment to begin customizing the integration.

2. **Customize the Template**
   Modify the cloned template to suit the specifications of the gift card provider being integrated. This may involve customizing the Processor logic to interact with the gift card provider’s API for balance checks, redemptions, cancellations, and refunds.

3. **Install and Deploy the Connector**
   Once customized, you need to install the connector in your commercetools environment using the Connector API.
   Create a deployment for the connector to enable it to run within the commercetools Connect environment. For detailed steps on installing and deploying connectors, refer to the [commercetools Connector Deployment Guide](https://docs.commercetools.com/certifications/build-and-deploy-custom-connector/overview).

### API Reference

#### Enabler

The provided JavaScript interface defines how the **Giftcard Enabler** is initialized and how it integrates with commercetools Checkout to support gift card payment functionality. Below is a breakdown of each part of the interface:

---

##### Interface: `GiftcardEnabler`

This is the main interface that initializes the gift card enabler and allows the system to create a `GiftCardBuilder`.

```
createGiftCardBuilder: () => Promise<GiftCardBuilder | never>;
```

* `createGiftCardBuilder`
  A function that returns a `Promise` which resolves to a `GiftcardBuilder`. If the initialization fails, the promise throws an error (never).
  This method is essential for setting up the enabler, ensuring that the builder for gift cards is available and ready to create components.
  The `createGiftardBuilder` method acts as the entry point for the enabler, providing access to the builder that can generate the necessary UI components for the gift card input fields.

---

##### Type: `EnablerOptions`

This type defines the properties that can be passed when initialising the enabler. 

* `processorUrl`: 
  A string representing the url of the processor the enabler would communicate with.
* `sessionId`: 
  Required to authenticate requests to the processor. 
* `locale`: 
  An optional string to be used to specify locales, values could vary from “en” to “de”. Defaults to “en”.
* `onComplete`: 
  An optional callback function to receive payment success events.
* `onError`: 
  An optional. callback function to receive error events.

---

##### Type: `EnablerOptions`

This type defines the options that can be passed to configure the behavior of the gift card payment process when it is built by the GiftCardBuilder.

```
export type GiftcardOptions = {
  onGiftCardReady?: () => Promise<void>;
  onGiftCardSubmit?: () => Promise<void>;
  onChange?: (isDirty: boolean) => void;
};
```

* `onGiftCardReady`:
  An optional callback function that returns a promise. This is invoked when the gift card component is ready to be displayed or interacted with. It's useful for notifying the system that the gift card UI is fully loaded.

* `onGiftCardSubmit`:
  Another optional callback function that returns a promise. This is triggered when the user submits the gift card form (e.g., when they attempt to pay using a gift card). This callback allows for custom handling of the submission event.

* `onChange`:
  Another optional callback function that triggers when a change occurs on the gift card input field. It takes a boolean parameter isDirty to indicate whether the input field value has been modified. This callback function can be used by integrators of this connector to detect when there is a change in the input field.

These options allow developers to hook into the gift card lifecycle events and perform additional logic, like displaying loading indicators or processing custom analytics.

---

##### Interface: `GiftcardBuilder`
The GiftcardBuilder interface is responsible for constructing a GiftcardComponent that can be integrated into the checkout page.

```
build(config: GiftcardOptions): GiftcardComponent;
```

* `build(config: GiftcardOptions)`:
  This method takes in a `GiftcardOptions` object (described above) to customize the behavior of the gift card component. It returns a `GiftcardComponent` that is then used to manage the gift card interaction (like displaying the input fields, retrieving the balance, and submitting the payment).
  This method builds the actual component that will be displayed to the user and enables interaction with the gift card system.

---

##### Type: `BalanceType`

This type defines the structure for the gift card balance information that is returned when the system checks the card’s balance.

* `status`:
  Indicates the status of the balance check. 
  * `state`:
    * `"Valid"`: The gift card is valid, and the balance is retrievable.
    * `"NotFound"`: The gift card could not be found.
    * `"Expired"`: The gift card has expired.
    * `"CurrencyNotMatch"`: The currency of the gift card does not match the currency of the cart.
    * `"ZeroBalance"`: A valid gift card with 0 as balance
    * `"GenericError"`: Any other error that does not fall under previous cases.

  * `errors?[]`:
    List of errors in case any. 
    * `code`: Error code
    * `message`: Error message
    
* `amount?`: 
  Contains the balance information:
  * `centAmount`: The balance amount in the smallest currency unit (e.g., cents for USD).
  * `currency`: The currency of the gift card balance (e.g., USD, EUR).

This type encapsulates the result of a balance check, including whether the gift card is valid and the available amount.

---

##### Interface: `GiftcardComponent`

This is the actual UI component that users interact with during the checkout process.

```
export interface GiftcardComponent {
  balance(): Promise<BalanceType>;
  submit(opts: {amount?: {centAmount: number, currency: number}}): void;
  mount(selector: string): void;
}
```

* `balance()`:
  This function returns a `Promise` that resolves to a `BalanceType`. It allows the enabler to check the balance of the gift card based on the user’s input. The balance function communicates with the backend (or processor) to retrieve the current balance from the gift card provider.

* `submit(opts: {amount?: {centAmount: number, currency: number}})`:
  This method triggers the gift card payment process. It does not return a value, but initiates communication between the enabler and the gift card provider to redeem the card's balance for the payment. In case amount is passed, it will redeem at most the amount specified.

* `mount(selector: string)`:
  This method mounts the gift card UI component into the DOM at the specified `selector` (e.g., a div element in the checkout page). It allows the UI elements for the gift card to be dynamically added to the page when the component is built and ready.

The `GiftcardComponent` is the actual interface between the frontend and the gift card provider. It provides methods to interact with the user input (balance checks, submitting the payment) and mounts the gift card fields on the checkout page.

---

##### Summary

This enabler interface provides the means to:

* Initialize and build the gift card component (`GiftcardEnabler` and `GiftcardBuilder`).
* Customize the behavior of the component with lifecycle events (`GiftcardOptions`).
* Mount the component onto the checkout page and manage interactions like balance checks and payments (`GiftcardComponent`).
* Handle communication with the backend (`processor`) to retrieve balance and process the payment.

This structure ensures that the enabler can be flexibly integrated into commercetools Checkout and provides essential tools to manage gift card transactions efficiently.


#### Processor

---

##### Status Check API

The **Status Check API** is designed to validate the configuration and overall health of the connector. This endpoint serves as a diagnostic tool to ensure the connector is properly configured and operational. It is particularly useful in troubleshooting scenarios where the connector might not be functioning as expected due to misconfiguration or other system issues.

This API responds with key metadata about the connector's status, including:

* Configuration correctness
* Connectivity status with the gift card provider
* Relevant environment information

By providing real-time validation of the connector setup, the **Status Check API** helps reduce downtime and minimizes support requests related to incorrect configurations during checkout operations.

This endpoint is intended to be invoked before during merchant center configuration to ensure the connector is ready for use.

           }
        }
     ]
  }
  ```

##### Payment Modification API (Checkout)

The **Payment modification API** facilitates communication between commercetools Checkout and the connector for managing payment transactions. It is a secure endpoint protected by the manage_checkout_payment_intents scope and is responsible for handling updates to payment transactions initiated by commercetools Checkout.

Supported Operations:

* **`capturePayment`**:
  Captures the authorized amount from the gift card and updates the payment transaction status in commercetools Core Commerce. The connector simultaneously updates the status with the gift card provider, ensuring that the funds are deducted from the card.
* **`refundPayment`**:
  Processes a refund by returning the specified amount to the gift card, updating both the payment transaction in commercetools Core Commerce and reflecting the refund status with the gift card provider.
* **`cancelPayment`**:
  Cancels a pending payment by voiding the transaction, both in commercetools Core Commerce and with the gift card provider. This operation is crucial for scenarios where an order is cancelled before completion.

This API is designed to be invoked by commercetools Checkout to ensure the accurate update of payment information. It allows the connector to synchronize payment statuses between commercetools Core Commerce and the gift card provider, ensuring both systems remain consistent. By supporting capture, refund, and cancellation operations, the API plays a key role in managing the full lifecycle of gift card transactions.

**Specifications** 

* `required`
* Endpoint: `GET /operations/payment-intents/{paymentsId}`
* Auth: `oauth2`
  ```
  Authorization: Bearer <token with scope manage_checkout_payment_intents:{projectKey}>

      }
    }
    ```
  * `cancelPayment`
    ```
    {
      "action" : "cancelPayment"
    }
    ```
* Response:
  ```
  200 OK
  {
    outcome: 'approved'
  }
  ```

##### Additional APIs


To complete the integration, the connector will implement additional APIs required by the Enabler for frontend interaction. These APIs handle core operations related to gift card balance retrieval and redemption, ensuring smooth user interactions during the checkout process.

An example API needed by the connector might be the `Get balance`

This API allows the Enabler to fetch the current balance of a gift card by interacting with the gift card provider through the Processor. It ensures that commercetools Checkout has accurate information about the available balance on the gift card before processing any payments. This endpoint is a protected endpoint, requiring a session ID represented as `x-session-id` to be passed as header while making a request to it.


**Specifications** 

* `optional`
* Endpoint: `POST /balance`
* Auth: `x-session-id`
  ```
  x-session-id: <session-id>
  ```
* Request:
  ```
  {
    "code": "<giftcard-code>"
  }
  ```
* Response:
  ```
